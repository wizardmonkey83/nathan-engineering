                    <p class="description project">
                        The primary objective of this project is to engineer a competition-ready, multidisciplinary underwater Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) from scratch as a core member of a UVA engineering club. 
                        The initial phase focused on mastering the fundamentals of underwater robotics, moving from a CAD concept to a functional, "Version 1.0" submersible. 
                        The project's ultimate goal is to strategically iterate and enhance this platform—by adding advanced sensor suites and manipulation-capable actuators—to successfully compete and excel in the 2026 MATE ROV Competition.

                    <p class="description project">
                        The principal outcome is the successful design, fabrication, and in-water testing of the "BURST" ROV, which validates the core structural, propulsion, and electronic systems. 
                        As a leader within the club, my contributions have been both technical and managerial:

                        <li><strong>Design & Leadership (Structures and Safety): </strong>As the Lead of the Structures and Safety Sub-team, I was personally responsible for designing the ROV's primary frame and overall component layout in CAD. This involved optimizing for weight distribution, hydrodynamic efficiency, and service accessibility.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fabrication & Assembly: </strong>I oversaw the complete construction and physical assembly of the ROV, translating the digital 3D models into a robust physical prototype using 3D design principles and mechatronic engineering practices.</li>
                        <li><strong>Electrical Integration: </strong>I was an active contributor to the electronic assembly, assisting with the complex wiring of the propulsion system (motors) and integrating them with the central control and power systems housed within the waterproof enclosure.</li>
                        <li><strong>Strategic Planning: </strong>In my new capacity as Lead Engineer, I am now responsible for defining the technical roadmap, setting engineering goals, and managing the team's efforts to develop the next-generation submersible for the 2026 MATE competition.</li>
